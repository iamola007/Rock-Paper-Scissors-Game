The game is played between the user (Player) and the computer (CPU)
Python's 'random' module was imported and the 'choice' method was used to get a random item from a list of options to get the CPU's input.
The user is asked to input a single character and this is validated and compared using an if statem in a while loop
The player and cpu inputs are printed if the user input is valid.
The winner is printed if there is a winner else the game will be repeated if it is a tie.
